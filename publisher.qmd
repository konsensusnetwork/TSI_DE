Konsensus Network was founded in 2019 with the purpose of publishing the Finnish translation of The Bitcoin Standard by Saifedean Ammous. We gathered a group of freedom-loving volunteers who were passionate about bitcoin, and we rose to the occasion.

FiveFour years later, and we have expanded from translations to original titles on bitcoin and economics, with nearly 100 books under our belt. We now operate as a hub between authors, license holders, translators, distributors, and production channels.

The next phase in our evolution is to champion freedom, not just bitcoin. This includes the ideals of Austrian economics, libertarianism, privacy, and thought-provoking futuristic fiction.
